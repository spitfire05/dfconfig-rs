# dfconfig-rs
A config/init file parser for [Dwarf Fortress](https://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/).

![ci](https://github.com/spitfire05/dfconfig-rs/workflows/Rust/badge.svg)
[![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/dfconfig.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/dfconfig)

## What?
A pure Rust implementation of DF's config file format parser, trying to be true to game's internal one.
See the [documentation](https://docs.rs/dfconfig/) for more info.

## Why?
I need a DF config parser/manipulator for one of my other projects.
Also, boredom.

## How?
This library is hosted on *crates.io*, so using it in your project is as simple as:
```toml
[dependencies]
dfconfig = "0.1"
```

## Contributing
PRs are welcome.
